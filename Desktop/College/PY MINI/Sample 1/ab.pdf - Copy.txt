My journey in the field of Computer Science started during my primary school days
when I got my hands on the first computer in my home, which I then used for
browsing, MS Word, and many other things. Later during 10th I got introduced to
Python and it fascinated me with the ability to make machines execute instructions at
my behest and its endless applications, I concluded to pursue a career in this field.
Hence, I enrolled in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at New
Horizon College of Engineering in Bangalore, Karnataka. I had to leave my hometown
in order to get exposed to the best talents and scholars who could help me to know
more about the wonders the computer could do. Joining here exposed me to various
kinds of options that I could take as my career The program is currently helping me
build a strong fundamental base with subjects such as Computer Programming,
Calculus, algorithms, and Database Systems.
